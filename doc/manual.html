		<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>SimpleRTS is an open source project developed by Tim Ernsberger, 
		Scott Sosnowski, and Feng Cao, under the advisement of Soumya Ray.
		The purpose of this project is to provide a simple but sophisticated
		test bench for use in testing artificially intelligent agents. SimpleRTS
		is based on <a href="http://stratagus.sourceforge.net/">Stratagus</a>,
		but does not include sophisticated graphics or sound, making it an ideal
		platform for running large numbers of simulations quickly.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Revisions">2. Revision History</h2>
		<h4>1.0.0</h4>
		<p>This is the first version of SimpleRTS. New versions will be published
		   as bugs are resolved and as additional features are added.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Run">3. How to Run</h2>
		<p>Note: this section describes how to run SimpleRTS from a Jar file. If you wish to
		   use the source code, you will have to figure that out on your own. If you do choose
		   to recompile from source you will need a copy of Google's 
		   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Guava library</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The basic command for running SimpleRTS is: 
		</p>
		<code>java -jar SimpleRTS.jar &lt;map file&gt; </code>
		<p>This will invoke the main() method in edu.cwru.SimpleRTS.Main. In order to run
		   a simulation, you will need to supply some arguments. Entering in insufficient
		   or incorrect arguments will cause the program to print out usage info and
		   terminate. Here are all the options that can be used:
		</p>
		<div><code>--config <i>&lt;XML configuration file&gt;</code></i>
			<div class="definition">These two arguments specify that you want to import
			    a configuration and which file to read to get it. This is an optional
			    parameter. If not specified, the program will use the last configuration
			    with which it was run or default values if no configuration data has been
			    provided previously.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div><code>--agent <i>&lt;agent class&gt; &lt;playernum&gt;</i></code>
			<div class="definition">Indicates that the agent defined by 
			    <i>&lt;agent class&gt;</i> should be used in this simulation. The full
			    path to the class must be specified (e.g. edu.cwru.SimpleRTS.SimpleAgent1).
			    By default, the program will use a single argument constructor that takes
			    in an int that represents playernum. The <i>&lt;playernum&gt;</i> parameter 
			    definies an ID with which the agent will be associated. 
			    <strong>At least one instance of this option is required.</strong>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div><code>--loadfrom <i>&lt;serialized agent file name&gt;</i></code>
			<div class="definition">This option can only be used immediately following
			    the previous option. If used, the agent specified by the preceeding 
			    --agent option will be loaded from the file instead of being constructed.
			    This option assumes that the data in the file is a serialized representation
			    of an agent. 			    
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 id="Config">4. Configuration</h2>
		<p>under construction
		</p>
		<h2 id="Agent">5. Writing an Agent</h2>
		<p>All agents written to interact with SimpleRTS must extend the class
		    <code>edu.cwru.SimpleRTS.agent.Agent</code>. Consult the javadoc for a
			description of the methods in Agent. At the very least, you must implement
			the initialStep(), middleStep(), and terminalStep() methods. These three
			methods define the logic for the agent to receive a state update and return
			a mapping of its units to actions for the next step.
